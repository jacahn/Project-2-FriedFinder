## Project Workflow
NA/incomplete - No evidence of planning(wireframes, ERD's, user stories)

## Technical Requirements
Performing - Your application has 3 models and includes a many to many association! I like that reviews join a restaurant to a user. There's a couple bugs with the use of basic auth in addition to devise. You only need 1 or the other.

## Code Quality
Performing - Code is maintained decently well. There aren't any comments though and there's some slight indentation issues.

## Creativity Interface
Progressing / Performing - Technically it meets the requirements, but overall just feels a bit unfinished. Like I said above, there are some barriers to entry because of the basic auth being in there. If you shore up those ends and add some more styles to the UI it'll help this app out tremendously.
